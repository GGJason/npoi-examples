# To Get Started with NPOI (on Windows 10)
1. Open PowerShell and run the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/nissl-lab/npoi-examples
```
2. Open npoi-examples/ss/CalendarDemo/CalendarDemo.csproj with Visual Studio 2019 community version and click 'Run program' button
3. You will see a new generated file called Calendar.xls under npoi-examples/ss/CalendarDemo/bin/Debug folder
4. Open the Calendar.xls with Microsoft Excel or Kingsoft WPS 
5. Go back to Powershell window and run the following command
```
cd npoi-examples/ss/CalendarDemo/bin/Debug
./CalendarDemo -xlsx 
```
6. You will see a new generated file called Calendar.xlsx under npoi-examples/ss/CalendarDemo/bin/Debug folder
7. Open the Calendar.xlsx with Microsoft Excel or Kingsoft WPS

_Conclusion_: The result of Calendar.xls and Calendar.xlsx looks same in Microsoft Excel or Kingsoft WPS but they are totally different file formats generated by NPOI.
